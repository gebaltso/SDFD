![Example images SDFD](https://github.com/gebaltso/SDFD/blob/main/examplesSDFD.png?raw=true "Example Images of SDFD")



We generated 1000 different synthetic face images that constitute the SDFD (Stable Diffusion Face-image Dataset). SDFD captures a broad spectrum of facial diversity encompassing not only demographics and biometrics but also non-permanent traits like make-up,
hairstyle, and accessories. 
We created various prompts that guide a state-of-the-art text-to-image model (Stable Diffusion 2.1)) in generating a comprehensive dataset of high-quality realistic images and can be used as an evaluation set in face analysis systems.


In order to produce images run the SDFD.py file.

Do not forget to change image output directory path as well as any other variable as needed.
