We generated 1000 different synthetic face images that constitute the SDFD (Stable Diffusion Face-image Dataset). SDFD captures a broad spectrum of facial diversity encompassing not only demographics and biometrics but also non-permanent traits like make-up,
hairstyle, and accessories. 
We created various prompts that guide a state-of-the-art text-to-image model (Stable Diffusion 2.1)) in generating a comprehensive dataset of high-quality realistic images and can be used as an evaluation set in face analysis systems.
